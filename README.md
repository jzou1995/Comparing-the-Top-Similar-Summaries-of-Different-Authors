"Comparing Top Similar Summaries by Multiple Authors using Excel Files"

This code is designed to analyze Excel files generated by the "Summarizing Academic Articles and Exporting to Excel" code, allowing for comparisons of top similar sentences across multiple readings by one or more authors.

The code will read all Excel summary files in the same folder as the Python file, extract the Summary column, and prompt the user to search for a specific quote. It will then display three boxes: 1) the quote itself, 2) top similar quotes from the same file, and 3) top similar quotes from other files.

With the ability to quickly identify similarities in how multiple authors have expressed similar ideas across different documents, this code serves as a valuable research assistant.
